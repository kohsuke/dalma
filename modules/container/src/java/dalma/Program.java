/**
 * Entry point of the user-implemented workflow application.
 *
 * <p>
 * A workflow application that runs inside the dalma container
 * needs to have a class that derives from this class. Such class
 * serves as the entry point to the workflow program, and its fully-qualified
 * class name must be <tt>Main</tt> (in the root package.)
 *
 * <h3>Configuring Program</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Program} typically needs to be configured with environment-specific
 * information to function. For example, perhaps a program is some kind of e-mail
 * automation system and may use 2 e-mail endpoints and 1 IRC endpoint.
 *
 * A {@link Program} communicates these configuration requirements to the container
 * by using {@link Resource} annotation. In the above example, the {@link Program}
 * would be written something like:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Main extends dalma.Program {
 *   &#x40;Resource
 *   public EmailEndPoint externalMail;
 *
 *   &#x40;Resource
 *   public EmailEndPoint maintananceMail;
 *
 *   &#x40;Resource
 *   public IRCEndPoint chatEndPoint;
 *
 *   &#x40;Resource
 *   public String greetingMessage;
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * At runtime, the container invokes setters and sets fields to "inject" references
 * into the program before the {@link #init(Engine)} method
 * is invoked.
 *
 * <p>
 * This object implements {@link Serializable}, so that
 * it can be referenced from {@link Workflow}s safely.
 * When serializing, the program object itself is not serialized.
 * Instead, a reference to it is serialized, and when a {@link Workflow}
 * is resumed it connects back to the running {@link Workflow}
 * at that point. Therefore it's safe to have non-serializable
 * objects on {@link Program}.

TODO
====
    - think of a better way to unify Dock and Generator
       isn't a dock a special case of a generator (in the sense
       that a dock lives shorter.) 

    - JMS messages aren't serializable
    - Use this to replace the build automation
        - write e-mail endPointoint (and qmail endPointoint)

	- users should be able to access their own state information easily
	  from Conversation (like Thread)

    - Check out Windows Server 2003 POP3 mail service
    - consider integrating with Exchange Server
    - consider sendmail integration

Notes
=====
- MimeMessage is not serializable
  this makes it ugly to work with e-mails.

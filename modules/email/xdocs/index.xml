        This e-mail endpoint implements an <a href="/nonav/maven/dalma/apidocs/dalma/EndPoint.html"><tt>Endpoint</tt></a> for the SMTP internet mail system. With this endpoint, a workflow can:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          send an e-mail and block until a reply is received
        </li>
        <li>
          start a new conversation when a new e-mail is received
        </li>

        This endpoint is implemented by using JavaMail. Out-going e-mails are sent by talking to a SMTP server, and the only thing that needs to be configured is the SMTP server's address. Incoming e-mails can be fetched from various sources, such as POP3, IMAP4, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir">Maildir</a> format. All of them are fetched by polling. It's up to a program to configure an endpoint.

Build Workspace
===============
Use Maven1

Using IDEA
==========
The dalma project comes with IntelliJ IDEA project files.
To use them, Run "maven fill-libs" to download dependencies into the workspace first.

In theory, Maven should be able to generate IDE project files for other IDEs,
but I haven't tested it.

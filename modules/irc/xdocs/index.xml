        This IRC endpoint is an <a href="../endpoint.html">endpoint</a> for the Internet Relay Chat system, implemented on top of <a href="http://martyr.sourceforge.net/">the martyr IRC library</a>. This endpoint allows a workflow to send messages, block until a new message is received, handle IRC conversations/channels, as well as perform basic IRC operations.

        Unlike traditional IRC bot frameworks, dalma allows your application to perform a long-running computation that involves IRC (for example, start a new business process triggered by IRC.) As usual, dalma workflow can survive VM shutdown, so your workflow can start today and report a result back two days later.

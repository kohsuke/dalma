<section name="Configuring engine">
  <p>
    Often a dalma engine needs to be configured in a highly environment-specific way. For example, if you are using the e-mail endpoint, you don't know what the e-mail address you'll bind to until you actually deploy the program. Or you might want to test the workflow application with a different e-mail address.
  </p><p>
    When you are in this situation, it's better not to programatically configure the engine from your application. Instead, consider the following approaches.
  </p>
  <subsection name="Configuring with Spring">
    <p>
      Dalma's <tt>Engine</tt> object can be configured from Spring beans framework. The following XML shows a sample Spring bean configuration file:
    </p>
<source><![CDATA[
]]></source>
    <p>
      Your application can then load this fully configured engine by the following code:
    </p>
<source>
XmlBeanFactory xbf = new XmlBeanFactory(new FileSystemResource(new File("dalma-engine.xml")));
Engine engine = (Engine)xbf.getBean("engine");
</source>
    <p>
      If you are going to use Dalma within Spring, this would be an obvious choice. Consult <a href="http://www.springframework.org/documentation">Spring documentation</a> for more about Spring,

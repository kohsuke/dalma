TODO
====
    - Check out Windows Server 2003 POP3 mail service
    - consider integrating with Exchange Server

    - 'redistribution' page
    
    - consolidate 3rd party license files into one per module

    - plain TCP channel
    - pick up JBI channel

    - write a document about error handling. error in the user code, persistence, etc.

James integration
=================
- Wraps a Dalma to as a phoenix component
  then you can connect to it from a mailet like this (replace UserStore with DalmaPhoenixWrapper):

  (From AvalonListservManager:)
  ComponentManager compMgr = (ComponentManager)getMailetContext().getAttribute(Constants.AVALON_COMPONENT_MANAGER);
  UsersStore usersStore = (UsersStore) compMgr.lookup("org.apache.james.services.UsersStore");

Container Version
==============
- valign 'must configure' warning text
- duck-typing delegation in Stapler
  - how does it implement UIObject?
- javadoc link among modules
- install it on other containers as a test before release
- define a place to put modules
- define module installer screen
- autoredeploy jar update issue.
  jar files seem to be locked and can't be re-written.

- don't send workflow application logs to the system log.

- file a bug against JSP, asking easier way to define functions

- add filter to logview.

- the container should remember which application is STOPPED and which is RUNNING.
  newly installed app should start from STOPPED state since it needs to be configured.

- file a bug asking for the -cp option in jconsole
- then expose enough information from JMX so that the web interface can be run on a separate JVM
  - such as information about the current conversation
- build the web interface on top of JMX

- JMX based management features (TBD later)
   see JMX.txt

- implement true auto-redeploy
    currently, we only check directory timestamp

- consider using commons-vfs. note that it was never released

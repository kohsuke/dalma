<section name="What is endpoint?">
  <p>
    An endpoint is a library that plugs into the Dalma engine and provides connectivity to the outside world for conversations.

  <p>
    In particular, endpoints provide blocking I/O, where a conversation sends out some data, then waits for some data to come back. Endpoints collaborate with the engine to transparently move the state of blocking conversations to a disk and bring them back to life when data arrives.
  </p><p>
    An endpoint typically represents one communication channel --- such as an e-mail address, a JMS queue, an IRC connection, etc. An endpoint also typically perform <i>de-multiplexing</i>; for example, more than one conversations may be using one e-mail address at the same time to talk to other systems. When receiving a message, the e-mail endpoint is responsible for delivering it to the right conversation.

    Dalma ships with several endpoint implementations, but it can be implemented by 3rd parties.
